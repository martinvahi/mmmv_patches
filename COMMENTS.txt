===========================================================================

mmmv_patches is a collection of patches that I, Martin.Vahi@softf1.com,
have created to other peoples' software. 

Only patches that have not been accepted to upstream trunk or 
where the trunk is considered to be too unstable, are included here. 
For example, one of the cases, where the patches are not accepted
by upstream developers is where the the upstream developers have either
temporarily or permanently abandoned the patched project.
